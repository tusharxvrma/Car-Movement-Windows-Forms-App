# Car-Movement-Windows-Forms-App 
A basic C# Windows Forms project with a **PictureBox** for car images, four buttons, and a **Timer**.  
- Buttons:
  1. Change Size - Resizes the PictureBox.
  2. Change Car - Switches car images.
  3. Hide/Show Car - Toggles PictureBox visibility.
  4. Exit - Displays a message and exits the app.

The Timer moves the car image across the form on load and stops after a set duration. Follows proper naming conventions and event handling.
